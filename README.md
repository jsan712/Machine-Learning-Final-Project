# Machine-Learning-Final-Project

This is a project completed in the Data Visualization and Machine Learning class I took in the Winter 2024 quarter at the University of Chicago.

This project uses a dataset consisting of roughly 3,500 images of Ancient Egyptian landmarks created by the user Marvy Ayman Halim on Kaggle. The original dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marvyaymanhalim/ancient-egyptian-landmarks-dataset.
